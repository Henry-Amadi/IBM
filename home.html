            <h2>The Visionary Behind IBM</h2>
            <p>
              Thomas J. Watson (February 17,1874- June 19,1956) was a
              distinguish American businessman, best known for his role as the
              longtime chairman and CEO of the international Business Machine
              (IBM). He is widely recognized for turning IBM into the most
              influential technology companies globally. Watson’s vision,
              leadership, and innovative management practice were instrumental
              in establishing the foundation of the modern computing industry
              <br /><br />
              Thomas J. Watson’s journey as IBM’s leader began with a vision
              that was both ambitious and transformative. He saw the potential
              to shape IBM into a “world-class” company, driven by cutting-edge
              technology, relentless innovation, and an unwavering commitment to
              customer service. Under his leadership, Watson pushed IBM to the
              forefront of the tech industry, focusing on pioneering
              developments that would secure its place as a leader in computing.
              He laid the foundation for what would become a technological
              powerhouse, instilling values that emphasized quality, dedication,
              and forward-thinking strategies that defined IBM's future.

          <p>
            Watson played a key role in IBM's growth from a small domestic
            company to a global technological powerhouse. His focus on
            developing cutting-edge data processing technologies propelled IBM
            to dominate the tabulating machine market. By the 1930s and 1940s,
            IBM had expanded internationally, with operations in Europe, Latin
            America, and Asia.

                  The name change symbolized Watson’s ambition for IBM to

        <p class="philosophies-text-2">
          Watson was known for his management philosophies, which became the
          back bone of IBM’s corporate culture. His famous slogan,
          <strong style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'">“THINK”</strong>,
          encouraged employees to approach problems with a critical and
          innovation mindset. He believed in fostering a corporate culture based
          on respect, customer service and employee empowerment. Watson famously
          said, “If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure
          rate”, underscoring his belief in calculated risk-taking and
          continuous improvement.

            </h1>
            <p class="philosophies-text-2">
              Watson introduced the simple yet powerful motto, “THINK,” to
              inspire IBM employees to approach every problem with
              consideration, innovation, and a solution-oriented mindset. The
              “THINK” slogan became a cultural touchstone within IBM,
              encouraging employees at all levels to engage thoughtfully with
              their work. This principle underpinned IBM’s operations, pushing
              the company to be methodical and purpose-driven, whether designing
              products or solving customer issues. Watson believed that all
              progress begins with thought, and this idea became a guiding
              principle not only for IBM but also as an influential concept in
              business management.

          Under Watson's leadership, CTR underwent a dramatic transformation. He
          focused the company on the emerging field of data processing,
          promoting the punched-card tabulating machines for business use,
          especially for tasks like accounting and record-keeping. In 1924,
          Watson renamed the company International Business Machines (IBM) to
          reflect its growing aspirations in global markets. Watson’s initial
          influence at CTR set the foundation for a cultural shift, introducing
          the disciplined, customer-focused ethos that would eventually define
          IBM.
